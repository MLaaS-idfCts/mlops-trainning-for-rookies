# MLOps
During this section you are meant to understand the concept of MLops, what it is, and what we aim to do as a team.

### TODO:
1. [Google what's MLops](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=mlops)
2. Read this glossary about [MLops](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/mlops)
3. Search what tools we have in the TS, don't need to know how they work, just what they do in a general sense, you'll get a deep dive into them in the future.

### Key Concepts:
- Main workflow of ML
- Devops vs Mlops
- What we have currently provided in the cloud?
- What parts of the workflow we didn't provide? Which tools can be used to fufill their purpose?
- What's the ideal workflow for a data scientist to work, what role do we fill in their workflow as a team?

### Final Exercise:
- Build a theoretical MLOps pipeline and present it to the team. In your presentation you will need to explain what product you chose for each part and why you chose it.
