# Jupyter
##### ETC: 1 day

Shall you aim for the moon but you were too drank, jupyter has enough (also enough resources, and you know, that sweet ml blockchain GPUs..)<br>

### TODO:
1. ###### jupyterlab
    1. Read the first paregraph (JupyterLab 1.0...) in [this site](https://jupyter.org/index.html) and try jupyterlab.

    2. Look at how they built it! there's nothing more fun than other people's source code. [just look!](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/base-notebook) and try to understand what they're doing in the Dockerfile and the start-singleuser script.
    3. You saw which docker image they used? in the army we like centos7, try to build it with centos7 base image (change the dockerfile a bit to make it work)
    4. Run it. works? Good. You may go to the jupyterhub section. IF not, we believe in you, try again.  

2.  ###### jupyterhub      
    1. Read [this](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/technical-overview.html) and click on the bottom links for Spawners and Authenticators (read them too ;) )
    2. Run jupyterhub on your pc with dockerspawner. Use the files provided. 
    3. Test your image in your hub. Try as user guest and as admin, checkout the diffrences.

### Key Concepts:

### Final Exercise:
