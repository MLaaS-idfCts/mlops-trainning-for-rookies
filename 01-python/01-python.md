- Let your instructor choose for you a random 10 exercises from [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/)
- Write a simple Fastapi server. Use gitlab to manage the code.
  - Make an API that gets a GET request with a amount (for example localhost:8000/api?amount=3).
    The API will return the first X "amount" of Splunk indexes. You can get the indexes from the Portal API.
