# Docker
##### ETC: 4 days
By the end of this section you will become a docker pro, know what they are, 
what is the difference between a container and vm, and how do they work. 
In the final exercise you will gain practical experience.

### TODO:
1. [Introduction](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b/)
2. https://training.play-with-docker.com - Getting Started Walk-through for IT Pros and System Administrators
    1. Do stage 1
    2. Stage 2: do everything up to Orchestration
    3. Don't do stage 3
3. https://training.play-with-docker.com - Getting Started Walk-through for Developers
    1. Stage 1: do only [Docker for Beginners - Linux](https://training.play-with-docker.com/beginner-linux/)
    2. Stage 2: do only [Live Debugging Node.js with Docker and Visual Studio Code](https://training.play-with-docker.com/nodejs-live-debugging/)
    3. Don't do stage 3
4. Read about Configure networking, Manage application data in https://docs.docker.com/network/

### Key Concepts:
-   container
-   security groups
-   container vs VM
-   image and layer
-   dockerfile
-   docker build and docker run
-   bind mount vs volume
-   dockerd
-   docker compose
-   docker alternatives

### Final Exercise:
Create a Dockerfile that packs your code from the previous sections.<br>
Give an example for a use case where VM is more suitable than a container.
