# Machine Learning
##### ETC: 13 days
I hope you like buzzwords because this is the hottest field in the hi-tech industry these days.
This section is a small introduction to an unbelievably huge field, so it is extremely recommended to
read more about this subject.

### Key Concepts:
-   Descriptive and inference statistics
-   probabilities distribution
-   Hypotsis testing
-   AI, ML and DL
-   model
-   supervised and unsupervised learning
-   dataset
-   problem types - regression, classification, clusterization, anomaly detection.
-   tabular data
-   linear regression
-   decision tree
-   neural network
-   CNN
-   ensemble
-   model metrics - accuracy, f1, etc...
-   tensorflow vs pytorch
-   data pre processing
-   bayesian optimization

### Final Exercise:
Create a model that predicts avocado prices. You can find the dataset in this folder.   
Try use everything you have learned to make the most accurate model you can!  
Then, pack your model as a python package, and add it to your app. Now, for the first time, 
your app is fully functioning! (of course that your full app must be deployed on yor Minishift).
