# Machine Learning
I hope you like buzzwords because this is the hottest field in the hi-tech industry these days.
This section is a small introduction to an unbelievably huge field, so it is extremely recommended to
read more about this subject. 


### TODO:
1.  introduction:
    1. https://towardsdatascience.com/clearing-the-confusion-ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-differences-fce69b21d5eb
    2. https://intellipaat.com/blog/supervised-learning-vs-unsupervised-learning-vs-reinforcement-learning

2. Kaggle guides:
    1. https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization
    2. https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas
    3. https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning

   Do lessons:
    * 2 - Intruduction to Neural Networks
    * 4 - Intruduction to Pytorch
    * 5 - Convolutional Neural Networks
    
    The rest is a bonus you can do on your own time (Highly reccomended)

### Final Exercise:
Create a model that predicts avocado prices. You can find the dataset in this folder.
Try use everything you have learned to make the most accurate model you can!
